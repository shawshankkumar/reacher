# Reacher

## Overview
Reacher is a full-stack web application that provides users with cryptic clues about famous destinations around the world. Users must guess the correct destination to unlock fun facts, trivia, and surprises about that location. The game includes features for tracking user scores and challenging friends to play.

I was already a part of Headout when I vibe coded this in roughly 1.5-2 hours to test how long it'd take for an SE to vibe code this project. 

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Remix.js, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Express.js, TypeScript
- **Database**: Neon
- **Deployment**: Vercel (Frontend), Render (Backend)

## Dataset
- init.json: Initial dataset for the game provided by Headout
- v1.json: Updated dataset with one new feature, clues have difficulty level

## Random thoughts
- It's painful to generate dataset without API. Use a script, first ask AI to get you 100 cities, then ask for clues and so on, it'll be less messy that way.
- Deepseek r1 is good and fast at generating content but quality sucks. Claude is slow but great. Open ai models, gemini and rest just suck at both rn.
